User: Marv, can I have an image?
Bot: \[*gives image*]

**Bonus if the user thanks the bot:**
User: Thanks, Marv.
Bot: \[*reacts to user with some form of happy emote*]

`The name Marv was shamelessly stolen from the SCP subreddit's bot Marvin (u/The-Paranoid-Android)`

## How it Works
Curated through users using a command to submit an image for the bot to use.
- 3 Folders: image, art, and meme
	- images are all generic images like cats, flowers, sky pics, or anything in between
	- art is for illustration, photography is relegated to images cause i said so `:3`
	- memes are self explanatory
- All images will be manually approved or denied
	- Sent to a channel where each image is given an approve and deny button, but also a change category dropdown to decide where the submission should be stored
	- Deny simply throws the submission away, but responses can be decided on
	- Approve saves the image to the respective image folders, setting its filename to the next number in the sequence of saved images
- Cog to contain /suggest command group, suggest group will have a per user cooldown of 6 hours(?)
	- /suggest image (attachment)
	- /suggest meme (attachment)
	- /suggest art (attachment) \[art name] \[artist] \[source url]

## Sending the Image
Embed containing the type of image set, the image, what number the image was out of all images in the folder, source with url (if art), and user who submitted the image
